Prerequisites:

If you want to just use the APP:
Node JS
lit-html
Page JS
http-server

And if you want to test the APP, these too:
Playwright (Integration Tests)
Mocha
Chai

Execution:
run 'npm install' (if you just want to use the app, add '--production' after npm install) while at the root(CarTube) folder in terminal
install http-server if needed
run 'node server.js' while at the server (server) folder in the terminal to run the Node JS server
run 'npm start' while in root(CarTube) folder in terminal

Alternatively:
If you don't want to or can't use IDE, you can do the same by navigating to the same folders in the normal Windows explorer, opening CMD in that directory and writing the same commands.

For Integration Tests:
After installing dependencies, run 'npm test' while in root(CarTube) folder in terminal
